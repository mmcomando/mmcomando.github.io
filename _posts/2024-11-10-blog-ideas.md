### Maybe I should write a blog

Sometimes I have a thoughtful mood. I think about technical topics. What is good? What is better?
Conclusions to this thoughts are helpful for me, so maybe they can be helpful to somebody else?

Blog should be a good way to check this out.

Potential topics:
- DRY vs KISS, no definitive answer and art of software development
- Rust allows me to be a bad programmer
- I am developing new OS distribution, Nix vs Arch vs Debian vs I just want to code
- After NixOs I can't go back but I don't like it
- Phylosophy of 'Reality' or how rust API is defined
