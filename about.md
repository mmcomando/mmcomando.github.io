My name is Micha≈Ç Masiukiewicz and I am from Poland.

I am software developer with more than 12 years of experience.
Mostly self thought althoug I have a master degree in the field. My starting point of the jurney was writing websites in PHP but writing games turned out to be much more interesting. Commercially I mostly write middleweare in C++.
I like to find solutions to problems and then find designs which will prevent problems to come back again.

In free time I enjoy trekking, playing piano or reading fantasy books.
